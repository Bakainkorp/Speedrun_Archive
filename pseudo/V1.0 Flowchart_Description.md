# Summary of the Flowchart

The flowchart is in the same repository as this markdown file. The original draw.io file is located [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e84m4x3AfZsfZlsLqMbhU9RhF7YyYyuo/view?usp=sharing).

All Steps with an accompanying flowchart image has been worked on.

Step 0. The program begins running. 
* If the "Saved.txt" file is present, go to Step 1. 
* If not, go to Step 2.

Step 1. The program begins scanning through the given "Saved.txt" file. All the scanned data will imported for the program to use. The program will proceed to Step 3. The format of the "Saved.txt" file should be as follows:


> "Game 1", 1

---
>>"1,hh:mm:ss:mmm,dd/mm/yyyy. " 

>>"2,hh:mm:ss:mmm,dd/mm/yyyy. " 

>>"3,hh:mm:ss:mmm,dd/mm/yyyy. " 

>"Game 2", 0

---
>>"1,hh:mm:ss,dd/mm/yyyy. " 

>>"2,hh:mm:ss,dd/mm/yyyy. " 

>>"3,hh:mm:ss,dd/mm/yyyy. "

Step 2. The program will create an empty "Saved.txt". Go to Step 3.

Step 3. This is the main menu. There are several options from here, and this is the beginning step where the user has control.
* If the user wishes to record their time via clock, go to Step 4.
* If the user wishes to view their data, go to Step 13.
* If the user wishes to edit the data manually, go to Step 22.
* If the user wishes to exit the program, go to Step 52.
4. The program will check if there is any data in "Saved.txt".
* If "Saved.txt" is empty, go to Step 5.
* If it is an existing game in "Saved.txt", go to Step 6.
5. A new Node will be created. The user is required to input the name of the video game being played, and if the milliseconds will be recorded. Go to Step 7.
6. The user will be asked to select the game, either by typing in the name of the game or by selecting from the given list of games.
* If the user wishes to play a new game, go to Step 5.
* If the user selects an existing game, go to Step 7.
7. The user will be prompted to start playing, given the specific keystroke (likely the Space or Enter key). With the keystroke, an on-screen timer begins.
* If the user wishes to restart the timer, go to Step 8.
* If the user completes the game, go to Step 9.
8. The user will type a keystroke indicating a restart. The timer stops. Go to Step 7.
9. The user will type a keystroke, indicating that the game is completed. The timer stops. Go to Step 10.
10. The user is asked to save the run that has been played.
* If the user saves the run, go to Step 11.
* If the user wishes to discard the run, go to Step 12.

* If the user wishes to run again, go to Step 7.
* If the user does not wish to run again, go to Step 2.
13. The program will check if there is any data in "Saved.txt".
* If "Saved.txt" is empty, go to Step 13a.
* If it is an existing game in "Saved.txt", go to Step 14.

13a. The program will ask if the user would like to add a new game.
* If the user says yes, go to Step 24.
* If the user says no, go to Step 3.

14. The user is asked to select a game. Go to Step 15.
15. The program will check if the game has any recorded runs.
* If there are recorded runs, go to Step 16.
* If there are no recorded runs, the user is prompted that there are no runs available for that game. Go to Step 20.
16. The program will display all relevant data. Go to Step 17.
17. The user will be asked if there are any specific runs they wish to see.
* If the user wishes to see specific runs, go to Step 18.
* If the user wishes to see all runs, go to Step 20.
* If the user wishes to skip, go to Step 21.
18. The user will be asked which runs will be showcased. Go to Step 19.
19. The program will showcase the runs the users requests. Go to Step 21.
20. The program will showcase all runs for the specified game. Go to Step 21.
21. The program will ask if the user wants to look at another game.
* If the user wishes to see a different game, go to Step 14.
* If the user does not wish to see a different game, go to Step 3.
22. The program will check if there is any Nodes.
* If "Saved.txt" is empty, go to Step 24.
* If "Saved.txt" has games saved, go to step 23.
23. The user will be asked if they would like to alter an existing game.
* If the user says yes, go to Step 29.
* If the user says no, go to Step 24.
24. The user will be asked if they would like to add the game through recording via timer, or manually.
* If the user wishes to record via timer, go to Step 5.
* If the user wishes to manually input data, go to Step 25.
25. A new Node will be created. The user is required to input the name of the video game being played, and if the milliseconds will be recorded. Go to Step 26.
26. The user will be asked to input data for the run. The data will consist of the run time (hh:mm:ss or hh:mm:ss:mmm) and the date of the run (dd/mm/yyyy). Go to Step 27.
27. The data will be saved into the Node. Go to Step 28.
28. The user will be asked if they would like to add another run.
* If the user would like to add another run, go to Step 26.

* If the user wishes to add more runs manually, go to Step 26.
* If the user wishes to add more runs via recording with a timer, go to Step 7.
* If the user wishes to change the information of the Node or specific runs, go to Step 31.
* If the user wishes to delete the Node or runs, go to Step 47.

37. The program will issue a warning. Go to Step 38.
* If the Node previously allowed milliseconds, the user will be told about how the program will discard all information.
* If the Node previously did not allow milliseconds, the user will be told how all currently saved runs will have 0 milliseconds.
38. The user will be asked if they are certain to change this value.
* If the user answers yes, go to Step 35.

42. The user will be asked if the new date is correct.
* If yes, go to Step 35. 
* If no, go to Step 41.
43. The user will input the new run number. All runs greater than or equal to the new number will be incremented by one. Go to Step 44.

* If yes, go to Step 35. 
* If no, go to Step 43.

46. The user will be asked if the new date is correct.
* If yes, go to Step 35. 
* If no, go to Step 45.
47. The user will be asked if they wish to delete a node or a run.
* If the node is to be deleted, go to Step 49.
